# Overview

The Send Me To Heaven app is being developed based on an old app by the same name. The 
app records a relative altitude of how high the device is thrown into the air. The 
design ffor this app is to help me better my understanding of Swift and how to make 
Apple apps. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This app is being developed in Swift, a langauge designed by Apple for Apple
devices. To write in this langauge I am using xCode, also designed for and by
Apple.
