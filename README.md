# Overview

The Send Me To Heaven app is being developed based on an old app by the same name. The 
app records the relative altitude of how high the device is thrown into the air. The 
design for this app is to help me better my understanding of Swift and how to make 
Apple apps.

# Development Environment

This app is being developed in Swift, a language designed by Apple for Apple
devices. To write in this language I am using xCode, also designed for and by
Apple.

* Work with an accelerometer to auto detect when the phone is thrown and when it lands
back in hand
